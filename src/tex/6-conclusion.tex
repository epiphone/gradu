What can we conclude about the research questions? Mention limitations and further research directions.

% 1. Why should a web application be migrated to serverless?

% 3. Do the existing patterns have gaps or missing parts, and if so, can we come up with improvements or alternative solutions?
% 4. How does migrating a web application to serverless affect its quality?

Threats to validity:
-

Future work:
- evaluating and benchmarking new patterns, especially Local Threading and Fetcher
